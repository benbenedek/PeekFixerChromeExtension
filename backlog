====> To publish a new extension version:
         1. Update the extension version in the manifest file (don't touch the manifest's version).
         2. Go to chrome://extensions and disable the published ('old') extension.
         3. In the extension section switch to 'Developer Mode' and 'Load Unpacked' the new version.
         4. Test the new version.
         3. When done, zip the entire folder of the extension (without unrelated files).
         5. In the Developer Dashboard 'Edit' the extension and select 'Upload Updated Package'.
         6. Once done, push the version branch to git and create a new version branch.



====> TODOS:

      // Add icon images to the extension, hopefully will add the icon as a tile to the chrome://extensions section

      // Notify me if something is not working correctly

      // Fix Peek bug: if choosing number of tickets and date quickly - the price stays '0'

      // add documetnation

      // if past date is selected in dashboard, disable add booking options for the tours

      // show customer questions and remove toggle link
      --> DO ONLY ONCE
      var customerQuestionsLink = $(".js-link:contains('Customer Questions')");
      if (customerQuestionsLink.length > 0) {
          customerQuestionsLink[0].click();
      }
      customerQuestionsLink.hide();
